# Basic Operating System

Purpose of this project was to create in C++ a simulation of operating system.
Most of the modules in this project are based on Linux.

It contains such functionality as:
  - file and folder system,
  - interpreter,
  - RAM memory,
  - virtual memory,
  - processor manager,
  - processes management,
  - pipelines,
  - command line interface,
  - synchronization of processes.
  
My task was to create interface based on linux shell.

I recommend to use x64 version of a debugger in Visual Studio.
